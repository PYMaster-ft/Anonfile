I am anonymous. I created this blog site to share what I have learned with you. I am currently working as a student in Cybersecurity field. So I created this blog because I want to share what I have learned with you.

So I would like to share with you many things like information security, system administration, ethical hacking and CTF writeups. So I write content as my hobby. So I think you will also learn new things by looking at my blog.
